# Hello, Nice to meet you!

##### My name is Dae Hyeon Song, A 4th year Computer Enineering graduating student studying in University of Saint La Salle. I have few months left to graduate and become a computer engineer 😁

##### I'm interest in Front-end development that creating mobile appication and web application. For that, I'm currently studying Flutter This is because Flutter is emerging as a current trend among the cross-platform frameworks, and there is a possibility of development in the future. I also studying Python, MongoDB and MySQL for a knowledge about Back-end development.

##### When I code and look at the results, it's very stressful when an error appears, but if the program works as I intended, there was nothing as happy as it was. There is still a lot to learn.

## Thank you for visiting. 😊
